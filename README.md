# Monitoring ESXi Machines with Nagios

I have taken this script from https://kb.op5.com/display/PLUGINS/Check+VMware+API+nagios+plugin and modified it to work with Monitoring::Plugin.
It was originally designed to work with Nagios::Plugin, but it is no longer available.

Please refer to the article on my blog for setup instructions.
